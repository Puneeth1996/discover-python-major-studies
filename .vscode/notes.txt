Why learn Python?
	Python is very simple to pick up;
	Python is much more general purpose programming language;





Keywords and identifiers
	Keywords are the reserved words in python;
	We canâ€™t use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier;
	Keywords are case sensitive;
        [Import keyword]
	Example: False, None, True, class, if, else, return, def, try, while, for, etc
	Total number of keywords: 33
Identifiers:
	Name given to entities like class, functions and variables
	Can be a combination of letters, digits and underscores, cannot start with a digit
	Keywords cannot be used as identifiers, special characters cannot be used
Python has straight forward Error indications;
