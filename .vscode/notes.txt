Its breadth of knowledge that I look at in python 


Basic installation for python 

    Anaconda package installed with Python3.6

Will also be using jupyter notebook, which will be installed as package with Anaconda


pip install pandas matplotlib nltk numpy scipy scikit-learn seaborn 
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install keras Pillow plotly


Why learn Python?
	Python is very simple to pick up;
	Python is much more general purpose programming language;





Keywords and identifiers
Keywords:
	Keywords are the reserved words in python;
	We can’t use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier;
	Keywords are case sensitive;
        [Import keyword]
	Example: False, None, True, class, if, else, return, def, try, while, for, etc
	Total number of keywords: 33
Identifiers:
	Name given to entities like class, functions and variables
	Can be a combination of letters, digits and underscores, cannot start with a digit
	Keywords cannot be used as identifiers, special characters cannot be used
Python has straight forward Error indications;

Comments, indentations and statements
	Start a line with a # or use triple quotes, ‘’’ 		‘’’
	Indentations are used (4 spaces preferred) to make blocks of code, a for loop
Rather than writing code in a single line try to write in multiple lines (can use \) to make code readable
The written instructions are called statements



Variable is a location in memory used to store some data; Variable declaration is not needed
a, b = 10, ‘Hi’
id(a) prints location of a
Data types:
	Everything in python is an object;
	Number: Integers, float and complex
	Boolean: True and False
	Strings: Sequence of Unicode characters, defined with quotes, indexable, slicable
List: An ordered sequence of items, like an array, can have multiple data type elements, defined with square brackets; Lists are mutable
Tuple: Defined with parenthesis, can have multiple data type elements, tuple is immutable, can be indexable
Set: Defined with Curly braces, Set is an unordered collection of unique items; behaves as a set in mathematics; does not support indexing
Dictionary: an unordered collection of key-value pairs, defined with curly braces and a colon, value accessible with key
	Data types can be converted provided the value is valid in both data types;
	List(‘Hello’) = [‘H’,’e’,’l’,’l’,’o’]
